MME:
19.5 total. Let's be a physics teacher and call it 20.
So divided by 4 people => 5 ideal days.
I think it is overestimated once thing's get going,
but even if it isn't you should be able to finish by Friday 13/06, so, ... right on target ;-)
Let's aim for a demo on the friday the thirteenth then, ... I'm sure nothing can go wrong ...

Also I removed alex and milad from the dev list in the table.
You can only have your name on one story at a time, not counting the 'done' ones.

Let's agree :
 - no status  == Todo
 - Doing      == dev is working on it
 - Done       == ... well done, then you take the next story in the list, no skipping, no pick and choose.
